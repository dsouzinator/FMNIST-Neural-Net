# FMNIST-Neural-Net
A Convolution Neural Network to recognize FMNIST Images. Created in Keras with Tensorflow backend.

The dataset can be found [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master/data/fashion)

To import the dataset you need the file mnist_reader.py that you can download from [here](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist/tree/master/utils)
Make sure it's in the same folder as the conv net file.

Got a maximum accuracy of 92% on test set when trained for 60 epochs.
